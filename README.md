# wsw-race-record-bot

Update the config file.
The error channel is to help me check what went wrong.

File structure
```
wsw-race-record-bot/
├─ wsw-race-record-bot-server-integration.py
├─ config.cfg
└─ demos/
   ├─ (contains demos) 
   └─ Backup_DBs/ (main_db and backups)
```
      
Run the program for the first time. There will be an error. There will be 3 files created in the Backup_DBs' folder. only keep the db.sqlite file.
Rename it to main_db.sqlite and rerun the program.

Most of the code was written by Ai.

The server timestamps were written by Kostik

Thanks to Kostik and Slice for their help
